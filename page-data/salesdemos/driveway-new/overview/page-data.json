This demo shows an integration made up of multiple components, all deployed using a full CI/CD pipeline.\n\n**Demo Description**: This demo shows the 'Scatter Gather' pattern being used to create an API which exposes three independent integration services being called in parallel from one request, with the result being combined into a single response to the user.\n\nThis pattern is often used in buying comparison sites e.g. for Hotels, Air Fares, Insurance, Financial Products etc.\n\nThe demo uses a full CI/CD pipeline built on OpenShift pipelines which builds containers for each of the components and then deploys them all together with all the correct credentials and bindings.\n\nIt also shows live deployment updates of integrations with zero downtime.\n\nIt shows live fixpack application with zero downtime - also showing that CP4i can run multiple versions of products at the same time and patch/upgrade them independently.\n\nShows tracing/Operational Dashboard to show the flow of the request through the system allowing performance bottlenecks to be applied.\n\n**Key Demo Points**:\n  - Deployments using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline\n  - Multiple components being deployed and bound together automatically\n  - Updating integration code with zero downtime\n  - Applying fixpacks with zero downtime\n  - Cross-Component Tracing through the stack (Coming)\n  - Different environments (Dev, Test) showing route to live and isolation of environments\n  - Environment-Specific Configuration and Policy overrides.\n\n**Product Capabilties**:\n  - App Connect Toolkit and Runtime\n  - MQ Messaging\n  - API Connect Management and Gateway\n  - API Connect Portal\n  - Tracing / Operational Dashboard\n  - OpenShift Pipelines\n\n**Product Version**: CP4I 4.1 on OCP 4.6\n\nHere you will be able to prepare yourself to deliver this demo.
