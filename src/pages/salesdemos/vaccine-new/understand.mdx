## Demo Scenario

The vaccine lots need to be kept at a constant temperature for a period of time. The sensor telemetry data coming from the refrigerated shipping containers is processed to assess cold-chain violations.

The solution for this use case includes streaming telemetry events, a stateful microservice to implement aggregation & alarm generation, and integration with a microservice to log issues against the refrigerated shipping container.

The diagram below describes this scenario:
