## Configuring IBM MQ

### Task 1 - Configure Message Queue (IBM MQ) to Authorize and Accept Data

As this is a brand-new deployment of the Cloud Pak for Integration, all instances of integrations, message queues, and APIs are deployed as microservices. You need to authorize the Message Queue service to accept incoming data from the integration running on a separate server.

1.Open a browser and enter https://github.com/ibm-cloudintegration/dte-labs/tree/master/Lab2-AccessBackendSystems/resources.You need to configure the MQ security.

3.Open a terminal window and enter unzip es-mq.zip. Unzip creates a directory mqconf.zip ~/Downloads/ directory. Do not unzip ace-mq.zip (this is a App Connect project).

![](images/lab2-task1.3.png))

4.In terminal window, find the mq pods, using this command: **oc get pods | grep mq**. Copy the mq pods (mq-quickstart-ibm-mq-0).

![](images/lab2-task1.4.png))

5.Execute the shell script to run MQ configuration (update the channel and security). Go to ~/Downloads/mqconf directory and enter ./loadmq.sh mq-quickstart-ibm-mq-0. The MQ configuration will be updated for this lab.

6.Open a browser and select on the Bookmark Bar (IBM Cloud Pak for Integration). From here, you are able to navigate to all the integration and development technology contained within the platform. Today, this technology Capabilities and Runtimes instances. Capabilities include: API Connect, App Connect Dashboard, App Connect Designer , Asset Repository and Operations Dashboard. To access IBM MQ click the Runtimes link. This task covers administering and creating a new queue in IBM MQ. IBM MQ for Cloud Pak for Integration has a web GUI, which the Integration Developer, with security authorization, is able to manage the different IBM MQ objects (queues, channels, topics and so on).

![](images/lab2-task1.6.png))

You might see this warning (Potential Security Risk Ahead). Click Advance.  And then click the link, Accept the Risk and Continue). Don’t worry there is no Risk for your workstation.

7.You see the IBM MQ Welcome Page and an important tile that can help you learn about MQ technology. Click **Create a queue**.

![](images/ace-mq-createaqueue.png)

8.In Create a queue page. You can choose queue type: Local, Alias, Remote, and Model. Click **Local** to create a queue.

![](images/ace-mq-localqueue.png)

9.Enter the queue name: **NEWORDER** and keep the default values and the click **Create**.

## Working with App Connect Enterprisa Toolkit (integration)

### Task 2 - Configuring the app integration flow

In this task, take an existing integration flow in ACE and modify it to send only the payload data to the NEWORDER queue.

1.Open a terminal window by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting Open Terminal.

2.Before starting App Connect Enterprise toolkit, let’s check IBM MQ IP address. In th terminal window, enter the OpenShift command, **oc get svc -n cp4i | grep mq** to get a list of services in the namespaces. and copy the IP address (**172.30.152.157**) which the port is **1414**.

![](images/lab2-task2.2.png)

3.Enter **ace toolkit** to open the App Connect Enterprise Toolkit.

![](images/ace-mq-acetoolkit.png)

4.In the Workspace Launcher window, create the workspace **/IBM/ACET11/workspace/ace-mq**. Click **OK**.

![](images/ace-mq-create-ace-mq-workspace.png)

5.The toolkit opens the project. Import the ace-mq.zip file that you downloaded ( see ~/Downloads/ace-mq.zip ). Select **File->Import->Project Interchange** and click **Next**.

![](images/ace-mq-import-zipfile.png)

![](images/ace-mq-projectinterchange.png)

6.Select ace-mq.zip in Downloads folder and then click Ok.

![](images/lab2-task2.6.png)

7.Verify **neworder** project is checked and click **Finish**. To view the integration flow that you deploy, click **neworder -> Resources -> Subflows -> getid.subflow**.

![](images/ace-mq-opengetid.png)

8.Click the **MQ Output** tile. In the lower-right of the Properties pane, open the Properties tab and click **Basic**. Enter the queue name: **NEWORDER**.

![](images/ace-mq-basic-neworder.png)

9.Click the MQ Connection parameter and enter the following settings:

```
  1.	Connection*: Select **MQ client connection properties** from the drop-down.
  2.	Destination queue manager name: **QUICKSTART** (case-sensitive).
  3.	Queue manager hostname: **172.30.152.157**. (When you entered **oc get svc**)
  4.	Listener: **1414**.
  5.	Channel name: **SYSTEM.DEF.SRVCONN** (Server Connection).
  6.  Save the flow (**CRTL+S**)

```
![](images/ace-mq-mqconnection.png)

10.Now, you need to generate a bar (broker archive) file. The App Connect Enterprise server uses BAR (Broker Archive) files to save compiled message flows, libraries, etc. We have created a file **neworder.bar** for this lab. In the Application Development window in the upper-left, on **neworder application**, right-click and select New then **BAR** file.

![](images/ace-mq-create-bar-file.png)

11.On the Window New Bar file, type the name of bar file: **neworder**.

![](images/ace-mq-neworder-bar-file.png)

12.	App Connect Enterprise opens a window: **Prepare window** .

```

  1.	Check REST APIs
  2.	Check Compile and inline resources
  3.	Click Build and Save
  4.	A popup window displays “Operation completed successfully.”
  5.	Click Ok and exit out of the toolkit.

App Connect Enterprise Toolkit saves and compile message flows, sub flows into a BAR file.

```

## Deploying a BAR file

### Task 3 - Deploy Integration BAR file as containers


In this task, deploy the integration flow as App Connect Enterprise containers running in Kubernetes on the Cloud Pak for Integration. You then test the integration API by calling the API to create a new order and confirm the response payload and data in the queue.

1.In your browser, return to the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.Under **Capabilities**, select the **App Connect Dashboard** line and click the instance.

![](images/lab2-task3.1.png)

2.When you deploy a BAR file, you create a new instance of App Connect Enterprise. Click **Create Server**.

![](images/ace-mq-create-server.png)

3.Now, in the Create an **App Connect Integration Server** page, define which integration tool generated the **BAR File**. Select **Toolkit Integration** and then click **Next**.

![](images/ace-mq-select-toolkit.png)

4.In this step, drag a BAR file or click to upload

![](images/ace-mq-drag-bar-file.png)

5.In the File Upload window. Open **/home/student/IBM/ACET11/workspace/ace-mq/BARfiles** and select the file new **neworder.bar** and click **Open**. Verify the path routes to the **ace-mq** folder.

![](images/ace-mq-new-file-neworder.png)

6.You see that **neworder.bar** has uploaded to be deployed. Click **Next**.

![](images/ace-mq-confirm-neworder-bar.png)

7.You do not need to use the configuration package (**Configuration package contains the files that you can use for App Connect Enterprise works with Databases, Event Streams, etc**) click **Next**.

![](images/ace-mq-configuration.png)

8.Now you configure App Connect, enter the parameters:

```

  1.	Enter Integration Server name: **neworder**.
  2.	Switch to **ON** to use **Operational Dashboard (tracing)**.
  3.	Enter Operational Dashboard instance namespace: **cp4i**.
  4.	Click **Create** .

```
![](images/lab2-task3.8.png)

9.You see the **App Connect Enterprise Dashboard** with the Integration Server **neworder** deployed and started. Click the **neworder** server icon.

**Note:** The deployment process takes up to 5 minutes, refresh the browser to see the BAR file deployed and started.

![](images/ace-mq-neworder-server.png)

10.Click the **neworder API** icon.

![](images/ace-mq-neworder-api.png)

11.This page displays and copy the REST API Base URL (**Endpoint**), use the base URL (in the example :  http://neworder-http-cp4i.mycluster-dal12-c3c-32x-4e85092308b6e4e8c206c47df210f622-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:80/neworder/v1/). It might be different.
In this page, you can download a swagger file (you can import this file in API Connect and access by way of API Connect).

![](images/ace-mq-neworder-endpoint.png)

12.Open a terminal window and enter the curl command: curl -k  --request GET http://neworder-http-cp4i.mycluster-dal12-c3c-32x-4e85092308b6e4e8c206c47df210f622-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:80/neworder/v1/00000. And see the results

![](images/ace-mq-curl-result.png)

13.You check the message arrived in queue **NEWORDER** in IBM MQ (**QUICKSTART**). You can check using IBM MQ Console. Open a browser and click **Cloud Pak Platform Navigator** and go to **Runtimes** and click **mq-demo** in the instance **Queue Manager**.

![](images/ace-mq-ckeck-message-neworder.png)
