### Introduction

Augment existing business functions with new applications using Kafka.

The most interesting and impactful new applications in an enterprise are those that provide interactive experiences by reacting to existing systems carrying out a business function. In this tutorial, we take a look at an example from the retail industry. Starting with an existing API orchestrating the business function to "place an order". Let's say that when a customer places an order, we want to provide a real-time response. We want to reward the customer with points in a customer loyalty app or gamification experience or sign them up for a certain email nurture program. To do that, we need each order to emit an event. The Cloud Pak for Integration combines integration capabilities with Kafka based event streaming to make the data available for cloud-native applications to subscribe to a Kafka topic and use it for various business purposes.

In this tutorial, you create a topic in Kafka, modify an integration flow to call an API, emit an event onto the topic, and use the tracing tool to verify the message from App Connect Enterprise to Event Streams.
The Cloud Pak for Integration - Operations Dashboard Add-on provides cross-component monitoring and tracing capabilities that enable IT personnel to quickly analyze performance bottlenecks and latency problems across integration components to help ensure high levels of service.

## Event Streams Topic

### Task 1 – Creating and Configuring an Event Streams Topic

Creating an Event Streams topic in the existing Event Streams instance.

1.Before you start the lab. Download **eslab.zip** from **Github**, open a browser and enter: https://github.com/ibm-cloudintegration/dte-labs/tree/master/Lab3-RespondtoEvents . Click **eslab.zip** .

![](images/lab3-task2.1-eslab.png)

2.Click **Download**. The file **eslab.zip** is in your  **~/Download** directory.

![](images/lab3-task2.2-download-eslab.png)

3.Execute **unzip eslab.zip** will create the work directory **~/eslab** with 3 files: **ace-es.zip** (App Connect Enterprise project), **setdbparms.txt** (App Connect configuration file) and **bootstrap.address** (you can use this file to store Event Streams Bootstrap Address).

![](images/lab3-task2.3-unzip-eslab.png)

4.In **Runtimes** click **event-streams** link (in the kafka cluster instance type).

![](images/lab3-task2.4-runtimes-eventstreams.png)

5.In the Welcome to IBM Event Streams page. Click **System is healthy**  and check the status of the instance.

![](images/lab3-task2.5-access-system-healthy.png)

6.Verify if all Event Streams components are running and ready.

![](images/lab3-task2.6-systemishealthy.png)

7.Click **Create a topic** to configure topic.

![](images/lab3-task2.7-createatopic.png)

8.View the full range of configuration options by setting the Show all available options to on. Create the topic as follows:

```
1.In Show all available options, change to On.
2.Topic name: customerinfo.
3.Click Create topic.

```

![](images/lab3-task2.8-createatopic-parameters.png)

9.The topic is created, click to **connect to this cluster**. By default Event Streams requires clients to be authorized to write to topics. The available authentication mechanisms for use with the REST Producer are MutualTLS (tls) and SCRAM SHA 512 (scram-sha-512). For more information about these authentication mechanisms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_Challenge_Response_Authentication_Mechanism).

![](images/lab3-task2.9-connecttothiscluster.png)

10.To connect an application or tool to this cluster, you need the address of a Kafka listener, a credential to authenticate with, and a certificate depending on the listener.
For this lab, use an External listener. App Connect needs securities parameters to access Event Streams, the truststore password, certificate and SCRAM user ID and password.
Save the bootstrap server **External (1)**, clicking the **copy icon**. You can use **bootstrap.address** file.
For this lab you use external listener to verify how to access Event Streams as external application.

![](images/lab3-task2.10-savebootstrap.png)

11.Click **Generate SCRAM credentials** .

![](images/lab3-task2.11-generatescram.png)

12.The Generate credentials for your application window you create credential name and how your application works with Event Streams. Credential name, it is your kafkauser. You can see this in the OpenShift console.

```
1.	Enter the credential name: customerinfoapp.
2.	Check Produce and consume messages, and read schemas.
3.	Click Next.

```
![](images/lab3-task2.12-generate-credentials.png)

13.In the window, Which topics does the application need to access?, you can specify which the topics, the application accesses.

```
1.	Check All topics.
2.	Click Next.

```
![](images/lab3-task2.13-which-consumer-access.png)

14.In the window, **Which consumer group does the application need to access?**, a consumer group is a group of consumers cooperating to consume messages from one or more topics. The consumers in a group all use the same value for the group ID configuration.

```
1.	Check All consumer groups.
2.	Click Next.

```

![](images/lab3-task2.14-which-topics-need-access.png)

15.In the window, **Choose which transactional IDs the application can access?**, you can control the ability to use the transaction capability in Kafka.

```
1.Keep No transactional IDs checked.
2.Click Generate credentials.

```
![](images/lab3-task2.15-which-transactional-id.png)

16.Back to **Cluster connection** window. Verify the bootstrap server as an external listener, the username and password in **Generated Scram Credentials**. Scroll to **Certificates** and click **Download certificate**. Save **es-cert.p12** and click **OK**. This file is in **~/Downloads**.

![](images/lab3-task2.16-download-p12.png)

17.Back to **Cluster Connection**. Verify the Certificate password (it might be different for you).

![](images/lab3-task2.17-truststore-password.png)

**Keep this window open**.

18.Open a terminal window, go to directory you created **~/eslab**. Open setdbparms.txt file and replace the parameters:

```

1.Enter over <securityIdentity> customerinfoapp from the Cluster Connection window, click copy icon from SCRAM username and paste over <SCRAM USER>.
2.From the Cluster Connection window, click copy icon from SCRAM password and paste over <SCRAM PASSWORD>.
3.From the Cluster Connection window, click copy icon from PKCS12 certificate and paste over <TRUSTSTORE PASSWORD>.

## Operations Dashboard (tracing)

### Task 5 - Using Operations Dashboard (tracing)

The Operations Dashboard collects data from all the registered capabilities (such as MQ) in real time. By default, and for this lab, 10 percent of traffic is sampled.

IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Operations Dashboard has adopted OpenTracing API specification for collecting tracing data. OpenTracing is comprised of an API specification for distributed tracing, frameworks and libraries that have implemented the specification and documentation.

o	Trace: The description of a transaction as it moves through IBM Cloud Pak for Integration platform.
o	Span: A named, timed operation representing a piece of the workflow (e.g. calling an API, invoking a message flow or placing a message in a queue or a topic).
o	Span context: Trace information that accompanies the distributed transaction, including when it passes the service to service over the network or through a message bus.

1.Go to the **IBM Cloud Pak for Integration**. Click the **tracing** application  to open the Operations Dashboard instance.

![](images/lab3-task6.1-welcome-tracing.png)

2.In the Tracing page, check the Overview page. You see all the products that you can use this tool: **APIC (including DataPower), APP Connect and MQ**. You see all the tracing of MQ, App Connect and APIC (You see how to configure tracing in APIC lab). Operations Dashboard Add-on is based on Jaeger open source project and the OpenTracing standard to monitor and troubleshoot microservices-based distributed systems. Operations Dashboard can distinguish call paths and latencies. DevOps personnel, developers, and performance engineers now have one tool to visualize throughput and latency across integration components that run on Cloud Pak for Integration. Cloud Pak for Integration - Operations Dashboard Add-on is designed to help organizations that need to meet and ensure maximum service availability and react quickly to any variations in their systems.
