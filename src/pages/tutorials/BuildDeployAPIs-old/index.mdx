---

import ArticleDetails from '../../../../src/gatsby-theme-carbon/components/ArticleDetails'

In this tutorial, you use the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration 2020.4.1 to deploy an App Integration flow on containers and expose it as a secure rate-limited API on RedHat OpenShift 4.6.

Extend your back-end integrations securely to partners and developers.
Extending access via APIs to your back-end integrations empower your partners and developer community to create new business value, technical value, and customer experiences for your products and offerings. Spur innovations where a number of technologies are combined to create something new, for example, extending the ability apply for loan pre-approvals that can be used within apps that search for cars or real estate. To do this, you must first create the back-end integrations, which combine data from existing core systems, disparate assets, or SaaS services with the ability to send critical data between systems reliably. Second, you need to provide APIs to your back-end integrations that secure access and apply rate limits.
In this tutorial, you learn how to deploy an app integration flow that takes data from one source and sends it to a message queue for reliable delivery. Then, you expose this integration as a rate-limited API secured by a key and secret. This integration flow is deployed quickly and easily as an independent, auto-scalable microservice running on containers. By using RedHat OpenShift as a foundation.

## Introduction

Implement enterprise grade messaging that is secure and reliable for any application across your backend integration architecture. Modern applications and APIs all need the ability to communicate data reliably between mission critical systems across internal/external data sources, networks, and regions. In mission critical environments your messaging infrastructure must be robust, reliable, and secure with the ability to integrate into your applications and APIs at pace and scale. In this tutorial, you create a message queue that receives order data from an API call to a retail ordering system. The red box in the diagram shows what you are creating and where it fits in the overall architecture of a mobile retail buying application.

## Configuring IBM MQ


### Task 1 - Configure Message Queue (MQ) to Authorize and Accept Data.

As this is a brand-new deployment of the Cloud Pak for Integration, all instances of integrations, message queues, and event streams are deployed as microservices. We need to authorize the Message Queue service to accept incoming data from the integration running on a separate server.
Cloud Pak for Integration provides a single solution for all of your enterprise integration needs. The platform provides a comprehensive set of industry-leading capabilities. Use any of them on their own or together through a single interface. Create, manage, and monitor all of your integrations across SaaS applications, messaging, streams, APIs, high-speed transfer, and more.
Unlock the power of your data and support the scale required for all of your integration and digital transformation initiatives.

## Configuring API Connect

### Task 4  – Configuring API Connect to test the integration

You've created an application integration flow and successfully called it via a REST API call! Now, to make it accessible to the rest of the world, it's important to add security around it—at least in the form of a client ID .This way, in addition to access control, you can get insights into which teams or customers are the least and most active. Adding security to an API is simply done via an OpenAPI configuration parameter. We can add rate limits to the API to increase the calls per second, minute, or hour to scale up as much as you need.

1.Open the browser window opened where you have the orders API window open. Click the Download **Open API Document** icon. You save as **orders-1.0.0.yaml** file in **~/Downloads** directory.
